mfp is a small set of classes that allows for easy flot graph
generation based on data from a mysql database.

mfp is licensed under the GNU GPLv3.

Patches / Pull requests welcome. Contact robert@keizer.ca.

The config for mfp is fairly straight forward. It consists of many arrays, nested inside arrays. For more information see CONFIG_README.

Current FlotGraph methods:
	"setTimeVar" which can either be "x" or "y", and turns the mode of the graph into time
	"setLegendPosition" which can be a string of "ne", "nw", "se", "sw", or false. False disables legend.
