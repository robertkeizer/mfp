mfp is a small set of classes that allows for easy flot graph
generation based on data from a mysql database.

Patches / Pull requests welcome. Contact robert@keizer.ca.

Config explanation:
	
The config for mfp is fairly straight forward. It consists of many arrays, nested inside arrays. An example is below.

graphArray => array(	"Graph Title 1"	=>	"options" => array(	"FlotGraphFunction" => "argument",
									"FlotGraphFunction2" => "argument2" ),
						"data"	=> array(
									"NameOfData" => array( "x" => "y", "x" => "y", "x" => "y" ),
									"NameOfData2" => array( "x" => "y", "x" => "y", "x" => "y" )
						),
			"Graph Foobar" =>	"options" => array(	"Function" => "arg" ),
						"data" => array(
									"Foo"	=> array( 1 => 5, 2 => 5, 3 => 5, 4 => 5, 5 => 5 ),
									"bar"	=> array( 1 => 2, 2 => 5, 3 => 6, 4 => 7, 5 => 10 )
						)
		);

Use of the SimpleMysql is suggested, to simply the (x) => (y) keypair. 

simpleMysql = new SimpleMysql( 'host', 'user', 'pass', 'database' );
graphArray => array( "Load Average" =>
			"options" =>
				array(	"setTimeVar" => "x",
					"setLegendPosition" => "se" ),
			"data" =>
				array( "MachineName" =>
						simpleMysql->getXYFromTable( "SELECT time, load FROM machine WHERE name='MachineName' ORDER BY time DESC LIMIT 200" ),
					"2nd Machine" =>
						simpleMysql->getXYFromTable( "SELECT time, load FROM machine WHERE name='machine2' ORDER BY time DESC LIMIT 200" )
				)
			);
